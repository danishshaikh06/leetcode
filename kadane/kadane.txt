🔹 Kadane’s — “Just make it as large as possible”

Kadane’s is greedy and continuous.
It walks through the array, keeps adding numbers as long as the total is positive, and restarts when the total becomes negative.

It’s like saying:
“Keep growing the sum — unless it starts hurting me.”

📘 Example:
nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
# Kadane → max sum = 6, subarray = [4, -1, 2, 1]


Kadane doesn’t care what the sum equals.
It only cares how large it gets.
