Use prefix sum when you need to find the sum of numbers between two positions in a list many times, or when you need to find subarrays whose sum equals a given number.

It helps you avoid adding the same numbers again and again.

🧩 Example (very simple)
Imagine you have:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
First, build a running total list:
prefix = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]

(each number is the total sum up to that index)
Now to find sum from index 1 to 3:
sum(1,3) = prefix[3] - prefix[0] = 10 - 1 = 9

sum(i,j)=prefix[j]−prefix[i−1]
